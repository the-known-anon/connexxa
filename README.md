Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, non-urgent healthcare services had reduced drastically and there is an increasing demand for remote outpatient solutions. The vulnerable population was suggested to self-isolate, and their caregivers may not be able to reach them.

Long-term vital signs are invaluable for physicians to make better-informed decisions. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, such as respiration and heart rate, plays a crucial role in early detection and even prediction of conditions that may affect the wellbeing of the patient.

Current wearable devices complemented with smartphones provide easy monitoring of vital signs, however, not every person has access to the internet or these devices.

In light of this, we would like to build a remote health monitoring system to tackle the digital divide by monitoring patients' vital signs through SMS chatbot, and visualizing health data collected for healthcare providers or caregivers.
